# Tic Tac Toe

This is an attempt to write a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) game using [Socket.io](http://socket.io) for realtime gameplay. Tic-tac-toe is a simple enough game, so I figured it would be an easy project to learn with.

I'm using this as a learning project, so expect that some parts will be messy.

I'm also going to be using this to learn TDD, and probably should have written the tests first, but I'll be doing that soon and going forward from there.
